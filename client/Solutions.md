# TicketMapper

This web application allows users to track their favourite personalities by viewing their current and future locations at any given time. It also provides users with further details about specific events, including the name, date, location and more. The initial view the user is presented with is the home page, where they have the option to sign-in with their account, sign-in as a guest or navigate to the sign-up page. For the purposes of this assignment, the user must sign-in as a guest since the back-end functionality required for personal accounts has not yet been implemented. Following this, the user will be directed to the search page, where they can enter the name of a personality or event of their choice. A valid entry will take them to a page displaying a list of results that were retrieved using the Ticketmaster API, whereas an invalid entry will inform the user about the invalidity of their search query. After the user selects a result, they will be able to view a list of relevant events, in addition to a Google Map consisting of markers associated with each of them. In order to view more information about an event, the user can click on the corresponding button. 

In the next phase of this assignment, we aim to implement the back-end functionality required to create personal accounts and store users preferences. This will give us the ability to incorporate additional functionality, such as allowing the user to follow certain events of their liking.
